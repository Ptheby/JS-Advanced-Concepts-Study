JS Sprint 2- Task for Sept 14 2023


9/13 i just realized i didn't save my README From videos 1-4 so i will try to remember what i typed and learned and had questions about?

Video 1- Just a baic overaly of the design pattern idea in where we take a "reuseable" apprach to specific types of coding or problems

Video 2- was the Builder Pattern- it is a creational design pattern used specifically so that we can build objects that might have
complex or optional paramters and instead of building them all into each object or class, we build a builder "class" that we use to construct those
objects step by steo

Video 3- Facade PAttern- in this patern it is in a structural pattern i believe where we can hide lengthy or unsightly necessaery code behind 
a more simplified version of that code often having one simplified version tied to one or more complex subclasses. 

Video 4- Oberserver Patternm-  this is a "subscription" model in which objects subscribe to an event and get notified when the event occures. 
There is an object, called the subject, that maintains a list of dependents/observers and notifies them of any state changes. 
In watching the video and coding along i have too many questions to ask here. I haven't learned most of the methods used 
like .eventListener. I will circle back around to this after I have gone through some of the other items in the task. I have sopent a couple hours on this one.

Video 5- Destructuring-
We learned that you can take an object or array and take out the properties or elements and assign them to their own variables.
We learned how you can skip elements in an array or take an ending sequence and assign the "rest" to a single variable using
the "spread syntax" of ...    
We learned how to swap variables by what i took was taking an object and then setting it to an array and just swapping the order?
Also how to get at a nested object inside an object.  This is helpful because it lets you much easier, get to the values of an array or object without
having to do it for every single one which is how the old way looked to be. I don't have a ton of questions about this at the moment and 
it seems that with a little practive it is easy to comprehend. ONe more thing it mentioned was pulling proeprties out of a function by
